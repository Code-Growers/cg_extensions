# cg_extensions

Fancy, yet basically useless extensions for dart language used internally at Code Growers s.r.o.

## Getting started

Just add `cg_extensions` as dependency and start using it right away:

```dart

export 'package:cg_extensions/cg_extensions.dart';

final String translatedYes = 'common.yes'.i18n(context); // 'ano'
```
